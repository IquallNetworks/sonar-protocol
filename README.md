Iquall's Open Protocol for communicating with Mobiprobe Sonar clients

Mobiprobe Sonar is a measurement tool originally developed by [Iquall Networks](http://www.iquall.net) to obtain network parameters, which allows users to monitor the availability and quality of the services, anywhere and anytime.

The project consists of a server side that handles all data collecting, storing and manipulating and a client side that gathers the data from the different measuring devices and sends it to the server.

The measurements are carried out in different measurement devices, which may be mobile or fixed units and range from conventional, open-access smartphones to embedded systems. The use of such devices as measurement tools allows to emulate the usersâ€™ perspective and obtain representative information relating to the operation of the network and its services.

The measurements are implemented through automated routines and events, which are executed in the different measurement devices and remotely managed from a web interface by the personnel from different areas, such as support, operation, quality or marketing.

The great potential of the tool consists in allowing the operators to program their own test scripts, using the graphical user interface (GUI) that the system provides.

Furthermore, the administration interface provides a set of screens and charts that offer a clear view of the results of the tests and the network parameters in real time during the test sequence. From this interface it is also possible to remotely manage the tests carried out in each device, establish their order and repetition, assess the results obtained and establish KPIs and alarms, among other functionalities.
